# Meta HN

Thought of making a meta discussion site on HN. Right now only the show/ask items are consumed by the Angular.js front-end.

# TODO

* Add login functionality

* Give the users an option to add comments

* Deploy to heroku free tier for the time being

* Write unit tests

* Integrate Travis CI
