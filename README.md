# Meta HN

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ahsanbagwan/askhn.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ahsanbagwan/askhn)

Thought of making a meta discussion site on HN. Right now only the show/ask items are consumed by the Angular.js front-end.

Build upon the styles provided out of the box by PureCSS.

Putting together a decent routing and then adding authentication to it.

# TODO

* Add login functionality

* Give the users an option to add comments

* Deploy to heroku free tier for the time being

* ~~Write unit tests~~ Already in place. Just have to build on it. Refer https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/testing-angular-with-karma Specifically the section on testing controllers.

* Integrate Travis CI
